I am a Professor at the School of Computer Software, Tianjin University. I received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively. From 2011 to 2013, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Computer Science, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology. In 2016, I was an academic visitor at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), University of Surrey.

My research interests focus on time series analysis and its applications to space weather forecasting, smart city intelligence, and popularity prediction. I have made sustained research contributions with over 100 publications in leading international AI conferences and journals, including IEEE TNNLS, NeurIPS, ICML, and AAAI.
