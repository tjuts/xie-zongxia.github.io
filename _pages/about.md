I am a professor of the school of Computer Software, Tianjin University. I received M. S. and Ph.D. degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China in 2005 and 2010, respectively. I also worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow with Department of Computer Science, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology from 2011 to 2013. In 2016, I worked in the center for vision, speech and signal processing (CVSSP) of University of Surrey as an academic visitor.

My research interests are on time series analysis and their applications on space weather and smart city. I have published more than 100 papers in top international AI conferences and journals, including IEEE TNNLS, NeurIPS, ICML, and AAAI. If you have any questions regarding my research, or may be interested in potential collaboration, or would like to discuss any other matters, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to the opportunity to cooperate with you.
